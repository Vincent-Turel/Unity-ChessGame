# 3D Chess game made on Unity 

## Context 
This project dates back to October 2021.

It has been realized in collaboration with [Julien Withfield](https://github.com/thekidvoomer) within the scope of the course *CS412/512 - Computer Games Design*  during my exchange semester at Bishop's University, Canada.

## Software

The game has been developped and tested under Unity version **2021.3.8f1 LTS** / JetBrains Rider 2021

## Description

This is an animated chess game where you have the ability to play against an AI as white or black, against another player and even watch an AI vs AI game. We have gone for a cartoonish art style.

Every rules of chess are strictly implemented including castling, promotion, and *en passant*.

Our AI has been developped using a minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to improve performances and speed. It works with a depth parameter which is set up to 1, 2 and 3 for Easy Medium and Hard respectively. For a depth greater than 3 the algorithm takes too long to process.

There are also many funny sounds/animations/explosions to discover !

## How to execute

Simply download the lastest release, unzip the build and use the executable in it.
